# Advent of code 2020 in DENO/TypeScript
New year comes and Advent of code with it. This year I feel most interested in DENO - which is TypeScript runtime (something similar like NODE for JavaScript).

This is my first try of DENO, so the code might be non-optimal, architecture not well designed, etc.

Feel free to contribute, I would like to know more about how to do things with DENO.
